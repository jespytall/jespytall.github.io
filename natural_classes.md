# Natural Classes Connections Puzzle
The New York Times has a game called "Connections," where you sort 16 words into four distinct categories. The hard part, though, is that you don't know what the categories are until you get all four words.

I have created a Connections-esque puzzle with four natural class categories each containing exactly four of the 16 sounds. It's quite hard, but you get as many guesses as you need.

A helpful chart of the natural classes can be found in [the textbook](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/chapter/4-5-natural-classes/).
