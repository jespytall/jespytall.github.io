## Perscriptive vs. Descriptive Limericks
The following are some limericks to explain the difference between perscriptivism and descriptivism in linguistics.

### "The Perscriptivist"
There once was a perscriptive linguist
who thought that he knew grammar things best.
"Don't say that," he said,
"use this phrase instead."
Come on, man, just give it a rest!

### "The Descriptivist"
There once was a descriptive linguist
who researched what grammar trends exist.
"We say this," he said,
"But we could say that instead.
It all just depends on the context."

### "Ain't"
If you say the word "ain't" every day,
a perscriptivist would say "no way!"
But as long as it could
be readily understood
a descriptivist says it's okay.
