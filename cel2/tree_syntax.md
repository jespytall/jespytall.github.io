# Tree Diagrams and Syntax (Ambiguity Analysis)

We have rules for how we interpret sentences. Sometimes, though, we do not know which rules to use for a given sentence. This introduces ambiguity in the interpretation of some sentences. To illustrate this, we will use the following sentence:

## "I shot an elephant in my pajamas."

### Interpretation 1

![A man hunting an elephant while wearing pajamas. Created by Microsoft Designer AI](/cel2/elephant_pajamas_1.jpg "A man hunting an elephant while wearing pajamas. Created by Microsoft Designer AI")


The most common interpretation of the sentence is that I, while wearing my pajamas, shot an elephant. the tree structure for this interpretation would look something like this:

![Tree diagram for "I shot an elephant in my pajamas."](/cel2/elephant_1.svg "Tree diagram for "I shot an elephant in my pajamas."")


### Interpretation 2

![A man taking a picture of an elephant who is wearing pajamas. Created by Microsoft Designer AI](/cel2/elephant_pajamas_2.jpg "A man taking a picture of an elephant who is wearing pajamas. Created by Microsoft Designer AI")

Another, more humorous interpretation, is I shot an elephant who was somehow wearing my pajamas. Elephants seldom wear pajamas, so this is unlikely to be the first interpretation that comes to mind.

Additionally, we can change the interpretation further by using the definition of "shoot" as "to take a picture of" rather than "to fire a gun at." This is a different kind of ambiguity called [lexical ambiguity](/cel2/panel3/ambiguity).
