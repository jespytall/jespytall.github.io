# Morphological Trees

On this page, I have made some morphological trees for the words "reimbursements" and "unknowingly." Derivational and inflectional morphemes are marked with a *d* or an *i* respectively.

## Reimbursements
![Morphological tree for the word "reimbursement"](/cel2/reimbursement.svg "Morphological tree for the word "reimbursement"")

## Unknowingly
![Morphological tree for the word "unknowingly"](/cel2/unknowingly.svg "Morphological tree for the word "unknowingly"")
