# Types of Deixis

Deixis is when words "point" to something that depends on context. The three types of deixis are:\
personal deixis, referring to a person;\
spatial deixis, referring to a place;\
and temporal deixis, referring to a time;

To demonstrate the three types, let's look at the following example dialogue. the deictic words are italicized.

- Person 2: Hey, *you*, is James *here*?

- Person 1: No, *he*'s not *here* right *now*, But *you* can come back *tomorrow*.

- Person 2: Just tell *him* to meet *me* *outside* *tonight*.

Now let's look at the occurences of the three kinds of deixis in this example.

- Personal Deixis: you, he, him, me

- Spatial Deixis: here, outside

- Temporal Deixis: now, tomorrow, tonight
