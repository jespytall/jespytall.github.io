# Denotation and Connotation

The denotation of a word is its literal meaning, but there can also be emotional, subjective, or otherwise implicit meanings associated with words, called connotations. Let's look at the following example:

## Cheap, Inexpensive, Economical

The words "cheap," "inexpensive," and "economical" all have the same denotation, or general meaning: they describe something that does not cost very much. However, let's look at how their connotations affect an example sentence:

### She bought her son an inexpensive car.

In this sentence, the word "inexpensive" tells us that the car did not cost a lot without making a judgement on whether that is a positive or negative thing. This is a neutral connotation.

### She bought her son a cheap car.

Using "cheap" instead implies that the car is potentially low-quality, poorly maintained, or otherwise inferior. Thus, we can see that the word has a pretty negative connotation.

### She bought her son an economical car.

The word "economical," especially when applied to a car, has an association with fuel-efficiency and frugality without sacrificing quality or performance. This is a markedly positive connotation.
