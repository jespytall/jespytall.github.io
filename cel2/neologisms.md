# Neologism Challenge

On this page I will be creating new words, called neologisms.

## Neologismatic

Part of Speech: Adjective

Method of Creation: Derivation (neologism + -matic)

Definition: Describing someone or something with a propensity for coining new words.

Example: "Shakespeare and his works were quite neologismatic; He coined [over 2,000 new words](https://repository.lib.tottori-u.ac.jp/record/7584/files/CLSNW2020.pdf), after all."

## Rushforthian

Part of Speech: Adjective

Method of Creation: Eponym (Rushforth + -ian)

Definition: Describing a class having periodic projects with many parts rather than exams.

Example: "The classes here are mostly Rushforthian, so instead of staying up all night studying students spend their evenings making posters."

## Sweatnap

Part of Speech: Noun

Method of Creation: Compound (sweat + nap)

Definition: A kind of nap after which a person wakes up covered in sweat, wondering what time it is, and somehow more tired than before the nap. Often 2+ hours long.

Example: "I'm sorry I missed dinner, I was resting my eyes and ended up taking a sweatnap."
