# Sense and Referent
In semantics, sense and referent are concepts used to distinguish between a word's meaning and what it specifically refers to in a given context.

## Sense
Sense refers to the inherent meaning of the word itself, the mental concept it conveys. The sense of "clock" involves the idea of a device used to measure and display time, usually with numbers, hands, or a digital display. When you hear "clock," you understand its general purpose and typical appearance based on its sense, even if you don't know exactly *which* clock is being talked about.

## Referent

The referent of is the specific entity that the word "clock" points to in a particular context. In a classroom setting, if someone says "the clock," they are likely referring to the specific clock on the classroom wall. That particular clock is the referent of the word "clock" in that situation.
