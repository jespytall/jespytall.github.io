# Verb Subcategorization

In this section, we will look at the valency of verbs. Valency describes the number of words associated with a verb. To demonstrate valency, we will use the following example sentence:

## Today I worked, bought lunch, and gave my dog a bath.

Let's take a look at the verbs in this sentence.

### Intransitive: worked

In this sentence, "worked" is an intransitive verb, meaning it takes no objects. We do not know what I worked on, just that I did some sort of work. 

Note: like most intransitive verbs, work can also be transitive (e.g. work a shift, work a stage). Some do not make sense as transitives (e.g. exist), but they are relatively rare.

Other examples of intransitive verbs are: emerge, cough, swim, sleep, and arrive.

### Transitive: bought

The verb "bought" in this sentence takes one argument, the direct object "groceries." Without the direct object, "I bought" would not make sense--without something to buy, I cannot buy anything.

Other examples of transitive verbs are: find, break, mix, like, and consider.

### Ditransitive: gave
"Sent" takes two arguments here: a direct object "a bath," and an indirect object "my dog." If we remove the indirect object to make "I gave a bath," we are left wondering *to whom* I gave it.

Other examples of ditransitive verbs are: tell, send, offer, lend, and teach.
