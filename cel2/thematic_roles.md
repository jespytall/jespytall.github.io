# Thematic Roles

In syntax, we categorize nouns into subject, direct object, indirect object, and so on. Similarly, in semantics, we can classify nouns by their thematic roles in a sentence. Thematic roles describe participants' (i.e., nouns') relationships to each other and to the actions and events in a sentence. The major thematic roles are: agent, cause, experiencer, theme, instrument, location, and goal.

## Examples

### The woman chased the mouse out of the house with a broom.

- **Woman: Agent**\
An agent has self-awareness and willfully causes an event / performs an action.

- **Mouse: Theme (Patient)**\
A theme is the object of an event/action. When a theme is affected by an action and undergoes some sort of change, it is often called a patient.

- **House: Location**\
A location is a place where an event occurs.

- **Broom: Instrument**\
An instrument is used by an agent to accomplish an action.

### The mouse was afraid of the cat.

- **Mouse: Experiencer**\
An experiencer is percieves something or experiences a mental state. They do not act on or alter the other nouns in the sentence.

- **Cat: Cause**\
A cause is something that causes something else to happen without agency or intention. Causes are often, but not necessarily, inanimate.


### The boy gave some cheese to the mouse.

- **Boy: Agent**

- **Cheese: Theme (Patient)**

- **Mouse: Goal**\
A goal is something that receives a theme. It can be a person, place, or something else. With most ditransitive verbs, the indirect object is a goal.
