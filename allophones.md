# Allophone Showcase

## /t/ --- [t] and [tʰ]
The phoneme /t/ contains both the aspirated [tʰ] and unaspirated [t] alveolar plosive.

In the word "top" the /t/ is aspirated ([tʰap]), meaning there's a puff of air when you say it.

But in the word "stop", the /t/ is unaspirated ([stɑp]), with no puff of air.

## /l/ --- [l] and [ɫ]
The phoneme /l/ contains both the velarized [ɫ] and non-velarized [l] voiced alveolar lateral approximate.

In "leaf", the /l/ is pronounced without velarization: [lif].
