# Middle English Reading and Analysis

On this page we will read an exerpt from Chaucer's Middle English work *The Canterbury Tales* and discuss the transition between Old and Middle English.


## Reading: *The Canterbury Tales*: Parson's Tale, Lines 16-23

*Ther cam a privee theef men clepeth Deeth,*  
*That in this contree al the peple sleeth,*  
*And with his spere he smoot his herte atwo,*  
*And wente his wey withouten wordes mo.*  
*He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence.*  
*And, maister, er ye come in his presence,*  
*Me thynketh that it were necessarie*  
*For to be war of swich an aduersarie.*  


## Analysis

### Orthographic variation 

During the period of Early Middle English (1150â€“1350), spelling was not standardized. Words were largely written phonetically, and pronunciation varied largely by region. examples above of othographic variation include *theef* (thief), *slayn* (slain), and *wey* (way). Standardization of spelling would not occur until after the advent of the Gutenberg press in 1439. the letters "v" and "u" were also used somewhat interchangably, as seen here in *aduersarie* (adversary).


### Pronunciation of silent letters

Letters that are silent in Modern English are pronounced in Early Middle English. Examples in this text include the final "e" in *pestilence* and *prescence*. 


### Word order and loss of inflections.

Compared to Old English, Middle English is a much more analytic language. Word order matters more because nouns no longer have as many inflections. There was no more grammatical gender, nor was there a dative case. Surviving inflections include -s/-es and -en for pluralization and -es (later -'s) to denote genitive case.

### Sidenote: "axe" (lines 8-9)

*"Go bet," quod he, "and axe redily*  
*What cors is this that passeth heer forby;*

In these lines, the word "ask" is written and pronounced as "axe." This pronunciation is typically associated with [Black English](/cel3/panel2/talking_black) and is often treated as incorrect, but it has been an accepted form of the word for over 1,200 years.
