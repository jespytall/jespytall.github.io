# Grimm's Law 

Grimm's law was formulated by Jacob Grimm, more famous for his and his brother's folklore collections, in 1822 to describe consonant shifts between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Germanic. It expanded on earlier observations by linguist Rasmus Rask.

Grimm's Law describes three major shifts:

- First, voiceless stops (*p*, *t*, *k*) became voiceless fricatives (*f*, *θ*, *h*), as in PIE *pisk-* ("fish") becoming Old English *fisc*.
- Second, voiced stops (*b*, *d*, *g*) became voiceless stops (*p*, *t*, *k*), as in PIE *déḱm̥* ("ten") becoming Old English *tīen*.
- Lastly, voiced aspirated stops (*bʰ*, *dʰ*, *gʰ*) became voiced stops or fricatives (*b*, *d*, *g*), as in PIE *bʰrāter* ("brother") becoming Old English *brōþor*.


## Examples

The result of these changes is that English and other Germanic languages look and sound different than their cognates in non-Germanic languages. Here are some examples:

| **PIE Sound Change** | Greek        | Italian    | Spanish    | English    | German    |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **p > f**            | **p**ódos    | **p**iede  | **p**ie    | **f**oot   | **F**uß   |
| **t > θ (th)**       | **t**ría     | **t**re    | **t**res   | **th**ree  | **d**rei\*  |
| **k > h**            | **k**árdos   | **c**uore  | **c**orazón| **h**eart  | **H**erz  |
| **d > t**            | **d**éka     | **d**ieci  | **d**iez   | **t**en    | **z**ehn  |
| **g > k**            | **g**énos    | **g**enere | **g**énero | **k**in    | **K**ind  |

\*Note: German does not have a [θ] sound, but the Proto-Germanic word, "þrīz," did.

## Conditioned Change
Grimm's law is a conditioned change, meaning that it does not happen universally but depends on the circumstances. For instance, When two consonants occured in a cluster, only the first was changed by grimm's law. This can be seen in words like Ancient Greek *ὀκτώ* (*oktō*), English *eight*, and German *acht*. The [k] here becomes a [x] (and eventually, in English, is dropped altogether) while the [t] remains unchanged.

There are also instances that look like inconsistencies at first. This is because [Verner's Law](/cel3/panel1/verners_law) further changed some voiceless fricatives into their voiced counterparts.
