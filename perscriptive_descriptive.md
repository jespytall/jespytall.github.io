# Perscriptive vs. Descriptive Limericks
The following are some limericks to explain the difference between perscriptivism and descriptivism in linguistics.


## "The Perscriptivist"
There once was a perscriptive linguist  
who thought that he knew grammar things best.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say that," he said,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"use this phrase instead."  
Come on, man, just give it a rest!


## "The Descriptivist"
There once was a descriptive linguist  
who researched what grammar trends exist.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We say this," he said,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we could say that instead.  
It all just depends on the context."


## "Ain't"
If you say the word "ain't" every day,  
a perscriptivist would say "no way!"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long as it could  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be readily understood  
a descriptivist says it's okay.
